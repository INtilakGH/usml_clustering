#### The purpose of this project is to detect the patterns of normal activity and traffic anomaly without using labels by unsupervised methods. This Network data has two high level classes - Benign and Intrusion. The intrusion class has several types of attacks, which we will try to detect.
#### In this project we will evaluate a few unsupervised models and apply dimensionality reduction techniques.
#### To achieve this, we will follow these steps:

- Collect Data: Gather the dataset for analysis.
- Process Data and Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Clean, preprocess, and explore the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Apply Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: Reduce the feature space to enhance clustering.
- Evaluate Unsupervised ML Models: Apply various unsupervised learning models to the unlabeled data and select the best-performing model.
- Compare with Supervised ML Models: Apply supervised machine learning models to labeled data to assess and compare their performance.

#### This Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017) is posted on Kaggle by posted by Chethan H N, and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset/data

The csv files used in this Jupyter Notebook contain daily network events hence are too big for uploading. Please access the datasets on Kaggle if needed using the above URL.
